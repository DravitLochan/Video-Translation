Baba...

2
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:08,266
<i>Yes, my son.</i>

3
00:00:08,425 --> 00:00:09,847
<i>Tell me</i> a <i>story.</i>

4
00:00:09,927 --> 00:00:12,100
Which one?

5
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:14,352
<i>The story of home.</i>

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,102
<i>Millions of years ago...</i>

7
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:20,862
a <i>meteorite made of vibranium...</i>

8
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:23,365
<i>the strongest substance
in the universe...</i>

9
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:25,447
<i>struck the continent
of Africa. .</i>.

10
00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:30,490
<i>Affecting the plant life
around it.</i>

11
00:00:30,656 --> 00:00:32,658
<i>And when the time of man came...</i>

12
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:36,670
<i>five tribes settled on it
and called it Wakanda.</i>

13
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:41,967
<i>The tribes lived in constant
war with each other...</i>

14
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:44,298
<i>until</i> a warrior shaman...

15
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:47,431
<i>received a vision from
the Panther Goddess Bast...</i>

16
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:50,638
<i>who led him
to the Heart-Shaped Herb...</i>

17
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:53,053
<i>a plant that granted him</i>

18
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:57,141
<i>superhuman strength,
speed and instincts.</i>

19
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:58,729
<i>The warrior became king...</i>
